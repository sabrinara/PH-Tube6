            <br>
            <p class="text-lg text-black"><b>Answer :</b> In JavaScript three of them is used to declare variables.Scope of var,let
                & const are discussed below- <br>
                <b>var:</b> var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped. Developers now-days use less var.
                var create variables that can be reassigned another value. <br>
                <b>let:</b> let declared as block scope.let create variables that can be reassigned another value.
                Developers now-days use more let. It can't define before it is declare. <br>
                <b>const:</b>const declared as block scope. const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned
                another value. If there is no need to change the value of a variable then it is good habit to use const
                as declare a variable. Developers now-days use more let. It can't define before it is declare.

            <br>
            <p class="text-lg text-black"><b>Answer :</b> 
                 <br>
                <b>Null:</b> In JavaScript Null is an assignment value, which is empty value. It means nothing or a blank value.<br>
                Which is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript. <br> 
                <small><b>Syntax: null</b></small> <br><br>
                <b>Undefined:</b> In this variable has been declared but value is not assigned yet in that variable. Then the output is undefined. For prevent undefined as output, one must assign a value to the declared variable <br>
                <small><b>Syntax: undefined</b></small>
